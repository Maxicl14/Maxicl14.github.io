    <br> Hi
    <br> It has occurred to me that there is a need to understand some things like:
    <br> \> Is a unit*unit=unit ? Yes. Even in non-commutative rings? What is a unit in a non-commutative ring? We need some definitions...
    <br> \> Can a non-unit*non-unit=unit? No, by Felix's proof. Given below for commutative rings?
    <br> \> Is a unit + unit necessarily not a unit?
    <br> \> There are then also things like 1s, one-potent elements (r^n=1 for some n>=0), 1-divisors (units) (definition less easy if in non-commutative ring but will define below. 
    <br> \> And things like 0s, zero-potent elements (r^n=0 for some n>=0), 0-divisors which can multiply by a non-zero element to still get 0.
    <br> \> Idempotent elements r^n=r for some n. These don't seem to link too much as the others do.
    <br> \> All the opposites of these e.g. non-1, non-0 (can a non-0 * non-0 = 0 is a question you may ask, and not get an answer unless you specify you're in an i****al domain)
<br> <br> 
    <br> <u>An exposition on the links of zeros, ones, zero divisors, one divisors. </u>
    <br> <b> We define, even for a non-commutative ring, a one-divisor (==unit) to be an element with both a right and left multiplicative inverse. </b>
    <br> This has the property of having the inverse to be unique and the same on both sides, by Ben's proof, given below.
    <br> ab = e = bc
    <br> bab = be = b
    <br> babc = bc
    <br> ba = e
    <br> ab=e=ba=bc
    <br> multiplying ba=bc by a on the left
    <br> aba=abc
    <br> ea=ec
    <br> a=c
    So the right and left inverses are the same, and are unique. So a=c=the unique inverse of b. If b has a left and right inverse. 

    <br> Broadly, our questions take the form of "Can class A * class B be in class C" or "Must class A * class B be in class C"
    <br> For example, if r is a nilpotent element, is 1+r nilpotent? Yes. In fact, 1+br is a unit for all b in R (for commutative multiplication, because then br is nilpotent if r is nilpotent).
    <br> Is unit+r a unit if r is zero-potent? Also yes. Get rid of the u and see it is in the form 1+ar for a in R. Now note that via this logic, all elements in u+(r1, r2, r3...) are a unit if u is a unit, where (r1, r2, r3 ...) is generated by the nilpotent elements of the ring. This gives us some information about the amount of nilpotent elements, based on the number of units in the ring.
