    Hi
    It has occurred to me that there is a need to understand some things like:
    > Is a unit*unit=unit ? Yes. Even in non-commutative rings? What is a unit in a non-commutative ring? We need some definitions...
    > Can a non-unit*non-unit=unit? No, by Felix's proof. Given below for commutative rings?
    > Is a unit + unit necessarily not a unit?
    > There are then also things like 1s, one-potent elements (r^n=1 for some n>=0), 1-divisors (units) (definition less easy if in non-commutative ring but will define below. 
    > And things like 0s, zero-potent elements (r^n=0 for some n>=0), 0-divisors which can multiply by a non-zero element to still get 0.
    > Idempotent elements r^n=r for some n. These don't seem to link too much as the others do.
    > All the opposites of these e.g. non-1, non-0 (can a non-0 * non-0 = 0 is a question you may ask, and not get an answer unless you specify you're in an i****al domain)

    <u>An exposition on the links of zeros, ones, zero divisors, one divisors. </u>
    <b> We define, even for a non-commutative ring, a one-divisor (==unit) to be an element with both a right and left multiplicative inverse. </b>
    This has the property of having the inverse to be unique and the same on both sides, by Ben's proof, given below.
    ab = e = bc
    bab = be = b
    babc = bc
    ba = e
    ab=e=ba=bc
    multiplying ba=bc by a on the left
    aba=abc
    ea=ec
    a=c
    So the right and left inverses are the same, and are unique. So a=c=the unique inverse of b. If b has a left and right inverse.
