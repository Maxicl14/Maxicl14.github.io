          <h2>Summary of the Project</h2>
          <p>This is a tennis ladder.</p>
          <p>It is set up so that you can play singles with other people interested in tennis without requiring tennis sessions. </p>
          <p>Scared of playing someone too advanced or too weak?</p>
          <p>The ladder deals with this. Initially I will place you around your level on the ladder, which is a table of players in order from top to bottom. 
          <p>To move up the ladder, you win, to move down the ladder, you don't play, or you lose. Or you ask me to moe you down. </p>
          <p>You can challenge the people above you in the ladder, so that you can win your way to the top if you have commitment.</p>
          <p>You arrange to play with people small games most preferably, so that the games don't seem like a thing you have to do, but rather fun little breaks during your work.</p>
          <p>I'll facilitate in making this easier by allowing you to borrow rackets/balls, I'm deciding how best to do this right now.</p>
          <p>When playing, you and your partner (the one you've challenged) can decide how to play the match, whether serving or not serving, how many games etc, based on your preferences. The default, if you can't decide, is a match to 4 games, serving. You can of course change this if the other person can't serve, and say you'll serve, but they don't have to. After all it's meant to be fun for everyone.</p>

          <h2>How do I participate? How can I challenge people?</h2>
Challenge on here

Agree somewhere

Book courts, get the key. Rackets you can borrow from me if you write a day in advance, or maybe I'll set up a station for you to borrow rackets. 

üí´üí´üí´TBD üí´üí´üí´


Play the game. Game standard can be decided between you, based on if you want quick games or shorter games. 

You can choose from:

-  a tiebreak to p>=10.

- normal games first to n>=3 games, 

- some other format (if you both agree on it and it's not too short)

- Please decide your format either on the day or earlier, but do make sure you both agree on it. 

- Very close ties in long games will reward the loser with one more point, do say if that was the case. 


Send to groupchat, I'll then update the rankings.

Challenge anyone with more points than you (3 spaces up) 


(To decide rankings, I'll send out an updated ranking for every time point exchanges are announced. )


You may use the 'back door' to exit the game. Returning members will be placed back at the bottom, with as many points as the lowest player currently in the game. 


If you can't/don't want to accept a challenge within the next 10 days, say so, you won't lose points. There is a net gain for playing matches. +6 -4. This is to ensure inactive members are pushed to the bottom and do not get asked about playing as much. 


In the event that the three people above you do not agree to play within the week, you get 5points for free. Arranging to play should be acknowledged on the chat with messages such as "A challenged B", then a dm to decide when to play, the  "B accepted to play A" or the alternative, back on the main chat. 


Any worries, do let me know. 


If you agree to play someone but don't turn up on the day, you lose 3points. 5-10mins wait time and phone call is required by the opponent before saying the other person did not show up. 


In the case of controversies

Lying will be investigated and punished by verbal rebound. You better not lie!


Points will be deducted based on my preference - I'm not a dictator, promise üòÅ

Rules may be adapted depending on circumstances. Tell me what you like and don't like


Point lose/win summary

+6-4  Win/lose

+6-3 Close game

+5  3 players refuse to play you (in a row)

-0 Do not accept challenge

-3 +0 Did not turn up

+1 +1 Rained off / Strong tie

-(smth) Lying/Cheating

Drop down to the bottom via the 'back door' functionality.

__________________________________________

Phrases to be used on the groupchat to ensure legality of challenges:


"A challenges B" - initiation statement in the groupchat - B's consent is not needed prior to this.


"B discusses with A" - when dm discussions have started about feasibility and date


"B accepts to play A and the date/time has been arranged."


"B refuses to play A"


"A and B cancel the challenge"


" A disagrees with B " - in case you don't think that's what happened. We'll have a bit of a discussion on the chat after that message. 


"Match rained off"

"A wins B"

"B wins A"

"B came close" etc


"B did not appear" - maybe dm me though for this, this is slightly embarassing. 


"I escaped through the Back door!"

"I have come back, father!"

(Any other humorous phrases that we'll appreciate) 


__________


Results:


Person on top will get a nice bit of paper saying they came top and a tube of tennis balls. 

Winning three will be rewarded with paper. 

Wooden spoon for the loser! (but not really a loser because there's also all those people who exited through the back door, shame on them for not being interested enough!(joking :)) 


Announced in a little meetup at the end of summer term, date to be decided!!!
