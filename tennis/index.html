          <h2>Summary of the Project</h2>
          <p>This is a tennis ladder.</p>
          <p>It is set up so that you can play singles with other people interested in tennis without requiring tennis sessions. </p>
          <p>Scared of playing someone too advanced or too weak?</p>
          <p>The ladder deals with this. Initially I will place you around your level on the ladder, which is a table of players in order from top to bottom. 
          <p>To move up the ladder, you win, to move down the ladder, you don't play, or you lose. Or you ask me to moe you down. </p>
          <p>You can challenge the people above you in the ladder, so that you can win your way to the top if you have commitment.</p>
          <p>You arrange to play with people small games most preferably, so that the games don't seem like a thing you have to do, but rather fun little breaks during your work.</p>
          <p>I'll facilitate in making this easier by allowing you to borrow rackets/balls, I'm deciding how best to do this right now.</p>
          <p>When playing, you and your partner (the one you've challenged) can decide how to play the match, whether serving or not serving, how many games etc, based on your preferences. The default, if you can't decide, is a match to 4 games, serving. You can of course change this if the other person can't serve, and say you'll serve, but they don't have to. After all it's meant to be fun for everyone.</p>
          <hr/>
          <h2>Challenging people</h2>
          <p>You can Challenge anyone with more points than you (3 spaces up at most) </p>
          <p>Challenge in the Whatsapp group by saying "A challenges B" a.k.a "I challenge JohnK". By the way, you'll need to come up with a nickname, read more about it later in the Registering section.</p>
          <p>B must accept the challenge by saying "B will discuss with A", and discuss the date and time and format of the match with A directly by phone or whatever. Or B might refuse to play with A for whatever reason, say because of work or lack of interest in the game, saying "B refuses to play with A".</p>
          <p>B does not lose points if they don't agree to play, but A may win 5 points if all 3 people above A have refused to play.</p>
          <p>If you accept discussions, you should pick a time and date to play, and this should be within the next 10 days or so after A has asked the question, for A's benefit, but can be longer if A accepts this. (we just don't want A to be held up and not playing if he/she wants to)</p>
          <p>After you've decided to play, write "B and A will play on ___" or just "A and B will play a match."</p>
          <p>Book courts on apps.jesus.cam.ac.uk/jerome courts 2 and 3 are better</p>
          <p>On the day, collect key to tennis courts from porters. Rackets you can borrow from me if you write a day in advance, or maybe I'll set up a station for you to borrow them.</p>
          <p>Play your match. Please decide the format before starting to play to avoid coonfusion.</p>
          <p>If the person doesn't show up to play, call them, wait for 10mins on the tennis courts, then leave. </p>
          <p>If you don't show up, you can lose 3 points.</p>
          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>If you win the whatever you're playing, you say "C won against A" <b>on the chat</b></p> 
          <p>You get <b>6 points</b></p>
          <p>A loses <b>4</b> points</p>
          <p>There is a net positive point gain, so that you are encouraged to play, even if quick games, and so that those who don't play will slowly sink to the bottom of the ladder, though slowly enough to not matter too much in the grand scheme of things to care about playing lots.</p>
          <p>Every time you win, I will take your results and update the ladder with them, changing the group description if I do so.</p>
          <p>You may challenge any time and with any frequency, but you may only challenge the 3 people above you in the ladder.</p>
          <p>Remember, if you are not accpted by any of them, you get <b>5</b> points and move up a bit.</p>
          <p> Extra points may be gained from having a very close match but losing. In the case of an exact 2-clear win by one person, the other gets an extra point for trying, thereby losing only 3 points in total.</p>

                <b>If you don not agree with what someone wrote on the chat regarding what happened in the match either say on the chat, or dm me directly. I'll see what can be done, and will talk to you about it.</b>

          <h3>Edge cases</h3>
          <p>
          person doesn't reply within three days. You play a "haven't replied after three days" card in the groupchat and assume they refused. 
          </p>
          <p>
            person doesn't show up to the game -  they lose 3 points.
          </p><p>
            person challenges more than one person at once - this is allowed!</p>
          <p>
            person decides they want some rest from playing - either stay and fall to the bottom slowly, or exit through the back door.
          </p>

  <hr/>
         <h2>The Back Door</h2>
          <p>A beautiful concept invented by - me.</p>
          <p>The gist is, if you don't want to play, and be bothered by replying to messages if you don't play, you can exit! Through the Back door. You may return again,a nd start from the bottom of the ladder with the amount of points the lowest person currently has. The Backdoor is a brilliant device to use, and is cool to say to!</p>
          <p>Upon return, please say "I have returned" or a humorous phrase of your own choosing. </p>
        <hr/>
          <h2>The Results - The actal Results that is!</h2>
            <p>Person on top will get a nice bit of paper saying they came top and a tube of tennis balls.</p> 
            
            <p>Winning three will be rewarded with paper. </p>
            
            <p>Wooden spoon for the loser! (but not really a loser because there's also all those people who exited through the back door, shame on them for not being interested enough!(joking :)) </p>
            
            
            <p>Announced in a little meetup at the end of summer term, date to be decided!!!</p>
